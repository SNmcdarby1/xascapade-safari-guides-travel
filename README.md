  - The navigation bar was not user friendly. I managed to simplify the color and typography to font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;

### 5. User Stories.

- The Navigation bar was not easily accessible . I have to try diffent designs that will anablethe client to press the home button to access other pages.
- The packages had no value , soi added up the value and uploaded images to show the product.
- The carousel in the gallery page was not working so i decided to have static images all in one page.
- The client asked to have different options of products . I added in the safari packages and different locations of the Safaris, and activities that can be done during the holidays.
- The reservation page had a lot of information icons that made the page look messy . I ended up reducing the content and be short ad precise of the contents.

* Web Design.
  I did a lot of reserch in youtube and i was inspired by three main developres
  - Sayar flight booking example
  * One of the users suggested that the images covered a lot of space on the computer and it meant that the user has to scroll p and down to view one image. I deciced to change that layout to that will allow the user to view ll the images without scrolling upand down.
  * tried to do a different approach that will be more user friendly by stripping down the contents in all the pages. Resulting to a change of design.

### 6. Wireframes

The xascapade wireframe is create using balsamic and downloaded it in the ide platform under documents as a pdf.
See attached below a copy of the wireframe.
1.drafted

- For clarity that all content and typography are clear for users.

- Familiarity that allows users to experience while navigating from page to page.

- Consistency to users to recognize the usage pattern of the website.

### 7. Technology

- Github[github](https://github.com/) used for storying and accessing data.
- Gitpod[gitpod]() IDE platform for creating website.
- While doing my reasearch i came across materializes platform.This site inspired me by the endlook and feel of the website, It resonates with a suitable ux friendly look and feel that embodies a lot of the features.
- Used w3school for snippets. I am inspire withthe look and feel of the navigation bar, and inputs examples in the w3school page.
- Youtube tutorial
- Multiple device mockup genarator. I sed this site to create a mockup image of the websites landing page. Thissight can be accessed in google webpage. once you access the page you will need to copy your deployed link to the in the multiple device generator that is on the top left top nav. Then click the genarator button to genarate the image of the website.
- Google Mapping - used (Map Quest)[https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/tools/latitude-longitude-finder/]. To find accurate locations. But unfortunatly it was not responding . I trie the Leaflet mapping.
- Emailjs - I created an accout with Google emailjs that will enable the emails to be interactive.
- I created the 404v folder to direct error responses.that will collect data from error messages.
- There were different tuturial that i watched in youtube. Below are a few that reall inspired byhthe style and design of the page.
- ECMA scripts reasearch page

* During my reasearch i came across a youtube tutorial that was talking about Materialize platform (Materialise)[https://materializecss.com/media.html]for creating websites and snippets by (Traversy Media)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaP3vO-vEsg]. I used the tutorial to create the index page . I aslo used snippets from -[W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/), and [Materialisecss](https://materializecss.com/), that helped me to come up with different designs of the webpage.

### 8. Trouble shooting

- Decide to change the li element to lo because the ux appearance was not suitable to the and user friendly 6 Testing
- While i was updating the git status i entered a git commit that change the changes that i had made . Resulted into doing a git reset command to using the SHA number f68f166.
- The navigation bar is glitching the dropdown links are not visible in the mobile devise. I decided to change and delete the dropdown in the navigation bar and decided to add a button that has etra pages.
- I encountered problems with the sidenav. Some of the content were not visible so i decided to change the design and use the navigation button that is displayed in w3school site.
- The navigation link was not working on small devices . I decided to use the button (xascapade) that has a collapsible id when clicked, to access the menu bar.
- My google maps was not responsive , ![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/287481355/00fe74efb7f78a7c4754aff4/image.png). With 404 and uncoaught syntax error. where i was able to get intouch with the support team and we managed to fix the bug.
- Email js was not responsive as well![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/287947159/50f3a6490df580d6a0e2c094/image.png). The support team help me find where the problem was and tried to fix it.
- The footer in the place was not working. I noticed that some of the tags were not closed once i did that the footer was visible to the user.
- I deleted the safari and booking page. Reason being i wnted to merge the form group with the contact placeholder. this makes makes it easier for the user to select and fill in the details without moving frompage to page. In the contact page i ditted text area and added input, i added collipsibles in the about page.According to the feedback that i received fromthe accessors one of the comments was that i needed specify the usage of the site. The collisible gives the user different ideas of the tours.
- Encountered a bug in the css style page. Received an error in regards to page formatting and i soved it by deleting the content and reload the file again.
- Did more research in google mapping i added more functionality using this link :(google map) [ https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete-directions]
- Encountering a 501 error response in Emailjs.
- 304 in jquery.js. I managed to do more research using the jquery error samples and stackoverflow.
- 404 i haven't resolved this but will get back to it.
- 304 ajax.js 
- css : Error: Library prettydiff.beautify.markdown does not exist. I was able to fix the bug by reverting the file, selected my page, right clicked, selected format document with, in the top of the file you are given options of selecting the type of format you would like to use, i selected default format, In accordance to the settings my default formatter is Beautify. I selected it and managed to secure the code. and finally saved the css/style.css file.

### 9. Deployment.

I deployed the page in Github page under settings.
In order to deploy the project, you need to push it to a remote branch and start a fresh workspace from that branch.
Every gitpod configuration is versioned in the root of your git repository. Once you have committed the changes made in your files.
Next the git push command is used to transfer or push the commit, which is made on a local branch in your computer to a remote repository like GitHub. The command used for pushing to GitHub as given below.
git push 'remote_name' 'branch_name.
Once you have succeeded you access the settings page in github. Select the desired repository. Click on the settings link on the top right side of your github navigation bar. In the settings page scroll down to the Github pages. Select the main-branch under the source. Once selected click the save button. A link will be enabled,once you receive the link you select it copy the link on your search engine. This will lead you to your public page. Ad that is how you deploy your repository to a public site.

#### Accessing  the online link 
1. Once you log in Git hub
![settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69846208/122625678-4bcbf500-d09e-11eb-9caf-a41ed1b442a8.PNG)
2. On the topnav select settings

3. If your page was deployed Scroll down to github pages select "click here". 
![cap3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69846208/122625705-5f775b80-d09e-11eb-9f76-9388eee6fa5e.PNG)
4. Will open up a page the link to your online link of your website.

### 10. Testing

Differrent types of Testing

1.validation testing by 3wschool validator. To verify that the code is clean. By scanning pages using W3C HTML/JS validator and W3C CSS Validator.
2.Git pod Unit testing and Usability System testing
3.Browser compatibility testing cross-browser testing is an integral part of system testing.
4.Responsive mobe testing. Check the mobile responsiveness of your website. By focusing on mobile-first indexing 70% of users prefer to browse the internet over mobile these days. By making sure the website should be as functional and pleasing on mobile as it is on desktops.
5.User acceptance testing –users test the application to make sure This activity is carried out either by the organization or by the client.
The site was deployed in github and i shared the link to family and other users through whats app platform that made it easier to access the links on their phones. I also shared the using emailing process for desktop users and other devices as ipads,tablets, etc. 6. The lighthouse test results of the pge was as follows, Performances is at 72, Accessibility at 82, Best performance at 86 and the SEO at 92. as it shows in the attached pdf.

- In the developers tool i accessed the the inspect the DOM by right clicking the mouse right button and select the inspect property. and i could edit different properties such as Appearance, Sources,Elements, Network,performance, Console and the lighthouse settings.
  as shown in the image below.
  ![Inspect](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69846208/110378143-21a17a80-804d-11eb-9594-1e1c29a331da.PNG)
- Validated the website pages in using the 3wc HTML CSS JS validator. Some of the errors we npt resolve. My plan is to revisit the pages and fix the errors. Most of the errors read that the <!DOCTYPE html is a parse, needs to be fixed.
- I experiensed  the navbar, It was not responsive. I ended up making a couple of changes that included a dropdown menu.
